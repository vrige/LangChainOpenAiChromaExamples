# App Using Flask and OpenAI

This is a Flask application that makes use of the OpenAI GPT-4 model to generate responses based on user input. Additional tools like langchain_community, langchain_text_splitters, and chroma package are used for document loading, text splitting, and data storage respectively.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:

- Python
- Flask
- OpenAI
- Langchain_Community
- Langchain_Text_Splitters
- Chroma
- Openai_utils

You can install the requirements by running:
``` bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running The Application

To run this application, clone the repository and run the python file 
`chroma_and_openai_rag.py`.

The application will then be accessible on http://0.0.0.0:8090

## Usage

The application accepts POST requests at the endpoint http://0.0.0.0:8090/conversate. Make sure your request has a JSON body with a 'query' field containing your query as a string.

Additionally, you can include a 'url' field in your JSON request to load and store new data.

Example request:
``` JSON
{
    "query":"Your query string here.",
    "url":"http://your-url-to-load-data-from.com"
}
```
The server response will be in form of a JSON object with 'query' field being your original query and 'output' field being the response generated by the GPT-4 model.
